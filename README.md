# Vendor Performance Analysis

**One‚Äëliner:** A clear, end‚Äëto‚Äëend analysis that consolidates purchase, sales, freight and price data to evaluate vendor performance, find outliers, and produce actionable insights and a Power BI dashboard.

---

## üöÄ Project Goal (in plain words)
This project builds a single, analysis‚Äëready table (`VendorSalesSummary`) from multiple raw tables (purchases, purchase prices, vendor invoices and sales), performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), computes vendor metrics (sales, profit margin, unsold inventory, stock turnover, freight cost), visualizes results, and packages an interactive Power BI dashboard for stakeholders.

This README tells you **what the project contains**, **how to run it**, **what each file/folder is for**, and **how to interpret the results** ‚Äî so anyone reading this will know exactly what the project does and how to reproduce it.

```

---

## üßæ Expected raw tables / files
Place your raw CSVs in a folder named `data/` at the project root before running ingestion. The notebooks/scripts expect (at minimum) the following logical tables (filenames typically = `{table}.csv`):
- `purchases.csv` ‚Äî vendor purchase transactions (VendorNumber, Brand, PurchasePrice, Quantity, Dollars, ...)
- `purchase_prices.csv` ‚Äî product price reference (Brand, Price, ...)
- `vendor_invoice.csv` ‚Äî freight & invoice level details (VendorNumber, Freight, ...)
- `sales.csv` ‚Äî sales transactions (VendorNo / VendorNumber, SalesQuantity, SalesPrice, ExciseTax, ...)

> If your CSVs use different filenames adjust `1_Data_ingestion.py` or rename files accordingly.

---

## üß© High-level data/schema (columns you will see in the final summary)
The analysis produces a `VendorSalesSummary` (also saved as `data/VendorPerformanceSummary.csv`) that contains aggregated vendor/brand level fields such as:
- `VendorNumber` / `VendorName` ‚Äî vendor identifier and name
- `Brand` / `Description` ‚Äî product identity
- `TotalPurchaseQuantity`, `TotalPurchaseDollars` ‚Äî sums of purchased units and purchase cost
- `TotalSalesQuantity`, `TotalSalesDollars`, `TotalSalesPrice` ‚Äî sums of sold units and revenue
- `PurchasePrice`, `ActualPrice` ‚Äî vendor purchase price and product price reference
- `FreightCost` / `TotalExciseTax` ‚Äî aggregated logistics/tax costs
- `GrossProfit`, `ProfitMargin` ‚Äî profitability metrics (computed in notebook)
- `UnsoldInventoryValue` ‚Äî computed as `(TotalPurchaseQuantity - TotalSalesQuantity) * PurchasePrice`
- `StockTurnover` ‚Äî inventory turnover indicator (present in notebook analysis)

> Exact formulas and column creation steps are implemented in `Notebooks/` and `Python Scripts/2_get_vendor_summary.py` ‚Äî open them to see each calculation line‚Äëby‚Äëline.

## üìå How to reproduce (Quick Start)
Open a terminal at the repository root and run the following steps:

1. Create a Python virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # on Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install required packages (example list):
```bash
pip install pandas sqlalchemy jupyter matplotlib seaborn scipy
```

3. Add raw CSV files into the `data/` folder. Filenames should match table names (e.g. `purchases.csv`, `purchase_prices.csv`, `vendor_invoice.csv`, `sales.csv`).

4. Ingest raw CSVs into an SQLite database (`inventory.db`):
```bash
python "Python Scripts/1_Data_ingestion.py"
```
This script will create `inventory.db` and log progress to `logs/data_ingestion.log`.

5. Build the combined vendor summary table:
```bash
python "Python Scripts/2_get_vendor_summary.py"
```
This generates the `VendorSalesSummary` table inside `inventory.db` and writes `data/VendorPerformanceSummary.csv`.

6. Open the Jupyter notebooks in order for exploration and to reproduce the visuals:
```bash
jupyter notebook Notebooks/1_Data_Import.ipynb
jupyter notebook Notebooks/2_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb
jupyter notebook Notebooks/3_Vendor_Performance_Analysis.ipynb
```

7. Open the Power BI file `PowerBI Dashboard/VendorPerformanceSummary.pbix` in Power BI Desktop for an interactive dashboard.

## üîç Key metrics & definitions (simple and clear)
- **Total Sales ($)** ‚Äî sum of sales revenue for a brand/vendor.
- **Total Purchase ($)** ‚Äî sum of purchase spend for a brand/vendor.
- **Gross Profit ($)** ‚Äî (Total Sales $) ‚àí (Total Purchase $) ‚àí related costs (freight, excise where applied).
- **Profit Margin (%)** ‚Äî `Gross Profit / Total Sales $ * 100` (noted in notebooks; open code for the exact implementation).
- **Unsold Inventory Value ($)** ‚Äî `(TotalPurchaseQuantity - TotalSalesQuantity) * PurchasePrice` (explicitly computed in the notebooks).
- **Stock Turnover** ‚Äî how quickly stock is sold over time (higher is faster). Implementation and exact denominator used are shown in the notebook.

---

## üìà Visuals included (what each image shows)
- `barplot.png` ‚Äî vendor/brand ranking by a chosen metric (e.g., revenue or profit).
- `boxplot.png` ‚Äî distribution and outliers for price/cost metrics.
- `columnchart.png` ‚Äî categorical comparisons (sales or count by vendor/brand).
- `countplot.png` ‚Äî frequency distribution of a categorical variable.
- `donutchart.png` ‚Äî contribution share (e.g., top vendors % of sales).
- `heatmap.png` ‚Äî correlation map between numerical features.
- `histogram.png`, `histplot.png` ‚Äî distribution of a numeric variable (sales, margins).
- `histplot_high_low_vendors.png` ‚Äî comparison of distribution between top and low performers.
- `scatterplot.png` ‚Äî relationship between two numeric metrics (e.g., total purchase vs total sales).

Open `Notebooks/3_Vendor_Performance_Analysis.ipynb` to run the code that produced these images and reproduce them with your own data.

## üéØ Key findings (from the notebooks)
- **Large outliers in freight costs** ‚Äî freight values vary greatly (min near 0, max very large), suggesting either data issues or bulk shipments / special logistics cases.
- **Wide price variation** ‚Äî Purchase and Actual Prices show high standard deviations; some products are premium priced.
- **Stock turnover is uneven** ‚Äî values range from very low (0) to high (>200), indicating inconsistent inventory management across items/vendors.
- **Strong correlation between total purchased quantity and total sold quantity** ‚Äî the notebooks report a very high correlation (close to 1), confirming purchases generally match sales volumes per brand/vendor.

> See `Notebooks/2_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb` and `Notebooks/3_Vendor_Performance_Analysis.ipynb` for plots and statistical analysis that support these findings.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended next steps / enhancements
- Add automated data validation for freight & price outliers.
- Build a scheduled pipeline to refresh `VendorSalesSummary` and push to a BI dataset.
- Add vendor segmentation and anomaly detection (e.g., flag sudden jumps in freight or negative profit margins).
- Time‚Äëseries forecasting of demand per brand to optimize purchase quantities.

---

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Notes & where to look for details
- **Exact calculations** and SQL used to assemble `VendorSalesSummary` are in `Python Scripts/2_get_vendor_summary.py` and in the notebooks ‚Äî open them to see the SQL and pandas steps line by line.
- **If a raw CSV has a different column name**, either rename the CSV column to match the script expectations or update the ingestion / SQL code accordingly.
